# #The 
# instructions
#  that tell a computer what to do are written in 
# machine code
# . Machine code is a series of numbers written in 
# binary
# . Each number represents a different instruction.

# Programmers find machine code difficult to learn, program in and 
# debug
# . As a result, the majority of programmers write 
# programs
#  in 
# high-level programming languages
# . These languages are close to natural language - the spoken and written language of humans. For example, 
# Python
#  uses 'print', ‘if’, 'input' and 'while' 
# statements
#  - all words from the English language - to form instructions. In fact, instructions often look like abbreviated English sentences
